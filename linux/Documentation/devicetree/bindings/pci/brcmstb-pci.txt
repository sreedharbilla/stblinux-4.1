Brcmstb PCIe Host Controller Device Tree Bindings

Introduction:
  The brcmstb host controller closely follows the example set in

	[1] http://devicetree.org/Device_Tree_Usage#PCI_Host_Bridge

  The rest of this document explains some added customizations and
  offers an example Brcmstb PCIe host controller DT node.

Required Properties:
  reg -- the register start address and length for the PCIe block.
      Additional start,length pairs may be specified for clock addresses.
  interrupts -- two interrupts are specified; the first interrupt is for
      the PCI host controller and the second is for MSI if the built-in
      MSI controller is to be used.
  interrupt-names -- names of the interrupts (above): "pcie" and "msi".
  compatible -- must be one of: "brcm,bcm7425-pcie", "brcm,bcm7435-pcie",
      "brcm,bcm7278-pcie" or "brcm,pci-plat-dev".
  #address-cells -- the number of address cells for PCI-space.
  #size-cells -- the number of size cells for PCI-space.
  ranges -- See [1]; a specification of the outbound windows for the host
      controller.  Each outbound window is described by a n-tuple:
          (3 cells) -- PCIe space start address; one cell for attributes
                       and two cells for the 64-bit PCIe address.
          (x cells) -- CPU/System start address, number of cells is determined
                       by the parent node's #address-cells.
          (y cells) -- Size of region, number of cells determined by the
                       parent node's #size-cells.
      Due to hardware limitations, there may be a maximum of four 
      non-contiguous ranges specified.
  #interrupt-cells -- number of cells used to describe the interrupt.
  interrupt-map-mask -- see [1]; four cells, the first three are zero
      for our uses and the fourth cell is the mask (val = 0x7) for
      the legacy interrupt number [1..4].
  interrupt-map -- See [1]; there are four interrupts (INTA, INTB,
      INTC, and INTD) to be mapped; each interrupt requires 5 cells
      plus the size of the interrupt specifier.

Optional Properties:
  clocks -- list of clock phandles.  If specified, this should list one
      clock.
  clock-names -- the "local" names of the clocks specified in 'clocks'.  Note
      that if the 'clocks' property is given, 'clock-names' is mandatory,
      and the name of the clock is expected to be "sw_pcie".
  dma-ranges -- Similar in structure to ranges, each dma region is
      specified with a n-tuple.  Dma-regions describe the inbound
      accesses from EP to RC; it translates the pci address that the
      EP "sees" to the CPU address in memory.  This property is needed
      because the design of the Brcmstb memory subsystem often precludes
      idenity-mapping between CPU address space and PCIe address space.
      Each range is described by a n-tuple:
          (3 cells) -- PCIe space start address; one cell for attributes
                       and two cells for the 64-bit PCIe address.
          (x cells) -- CPU/System start address, number of cells is determined
                       by the parent node's #address-cells.
          (y cells) -- Size of region, number of cells determined by the
                       parent node's #size-cells.
  msi-parent -- if MSI is to be used, this must be a phandle to the
      msi-parent.  If this prop is set to the phandle of the PCIe
      node, or if the msi-parent prop is missing, the PCIE controller
      will attempt to use its built in MSI controller.
  msi-controller -- this property should only be specified if the
      PCIe controller is using its internal MSI controller.
  brcm,ssc -- (boolean) indicates usage of spread-spectrum clocking.
  brcm,gen --  (integer) indicates desired generation of link:
      1 => 2.5 Gbps, 2 => 5.0 Gbps, 3 => 8.0 Gbps.
  supply-names -- the names of voltage regulators that the root
      complex should turn off/on/on on suspend/resume/boot.  This
      is a string list.  
  supplies -- A collection of phandles to a regulator nodes, see
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/ for specific
      bindings. The number and order of phandles must match
      exactly the number of strings in the "supply-names" property.
